**Instructions**
1. Download the XLS file and open in Excel
2. Modify the JSON node Snippets in the Snippets sheet if required. Current defaults use CMS sample. For example, if you do not intend to populate billing-code-description you might want to remove that field. The general idea is to make each snippet the size of your average snippet of that type.
3. In the "Calculation Sheet" enter data in the yellow cells.
4. Look at the "Total Size in Gigs" and then gasp in surprise !!!!

This is a simple tool which can provide a rough order of magnitude of the size of the file. It assumes only ffs, but the same model can be used for bundle OR capitation negotiation-arrangements if they are being used.
